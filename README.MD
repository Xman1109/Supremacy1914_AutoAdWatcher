# How to use

1. Open BlueStacks 5
2. Open Supremacy1914 on BlueStacks (if you haven't installed it yet, do so)
3. Click the Button that displays the section where you can get prizes by watching ads
4. Execute the **AdWatcher.py** File
5. Now go grab a coffee and dont touch your mouse or keyboard (Hold F5 to exit if errors occur)

# Troubleshooting

Q: The script does not detect/click the X button after the Ad has been watched

A: Press Windows+Shift+S and make a screenshot of the X button. Now save it as a .png file to the src/cross folder. (the name doesn't matter as long as it is a .png file)

Q: The Script crashes right after it has been executed

A: The BlueStacks windows should not be minimized. Another reason is that your screen resolution is too low or a part of the BlueStacks window is out of the screen.
