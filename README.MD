# Troubleshooting

Q: The script does not detect/click the X button after the Ad has been watched

A: Press Windows+Shift+S and make a screenshot of the X button. Now save it as a .png file to the src/cross folder. (the name doesn't matter as long as it is a .png file)

---

Q: The Script crashes right after it has been executed

A: The BlueStacks windows should not be minimized. Another reason is that your screen resolution is too low or a part of the BlueStacks window is out of the screen.

---

Q: The script says that BlueStacks is not running, although it is

A: The Name of the BlueStacks window has to be "BlueStacks", if this is not the case you can change the name in the Multi-Instance Manager.
